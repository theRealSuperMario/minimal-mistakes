Since my bachelor thesis I decided to focus my attention on the wide image processing field.
My first research experience was in the field of computational imaging where 
I was simulating unconventional camera systems. I was attracted by the unconventional thinking, hackiness
and yet high level of mathmatics applied to rather simple and familiar camera systems.

From the experiences of the thesis I continued the work as a student research assistant 
and initiated a project on computational glass free 3D displays. Tracing backwards some of the methods
applied during the bachelor thesis and the project on computational displays lead me to the medical imaging domain
and an internship at Siemens Healthineers, where I worked on deep learning based image quality assessment
and artefact correction for magnet resonance imaging. 

Currently, I am exploring the deep learning landscape both on
the application side as well as the theoretical side with some statistical learning theory. 
In parallel I am working
on semantic segmentation of LIDAR scans for autonomous driving.
