# What I am doing right now

Currently I am 
* learning about information geometry through the weekly theory-pdg paper discussion group at ML-KA, which I started together with [Leander](https://github.com/LeanderK "Leander on github"). [Read the notes](https://github.com/ML-KA/PDG-Theory "Theory-PDG")
* working on LIDAR data semantic segmentation
* organizing events at [Hack & Söhne](https://hackundsoehne.de "Hack & Söhne")
* exams

I was part of the organizer team for the [Open Codes Hackathon](https://opencodes.io "Open Codes Hackathon"). I was also a speaker at the Open Codes Hackathon.

### ML-KA

[ML-KA](ml-ka.de "Link to ML-KA") hosts weekly paper discussions group meetings (pdg) about Machine Learning. The classic pdg is Wednesdays.
Recently we started a theory-pdg branch that focusses on theoretical aspects of Machine Learning. The pace is slower and we go through the paper equation by equation (because it is so hard). Date and time via [ML-KA Slack](https://ml-ka.slack.com/ "Link to ML-KA slack channel"). You need a .kit.edu email address to sign in, however, you can get an invite from someone else as well.



## Teaching & Workshops

During my Bachelors I had a quite high passion for teaching and giving workshops. It revived a little bit through the activites of Hack & Söhne.

### Deep Learning Workshop

A workshop I did through [Hack & Söhne](https://hackundsoehne.de "Hack & Söhne") together with [Maximillian Franz](https://github.com/MaximilianFranz "Max on github") and [Leander](https://github.com/LeanderK "Leander on github"). We wanted to make very low level concepts clear and not just do tensorflow.train.
[See workshop page here.](https://hackundsoehne.de/deeplearning "Link to Deep Learning Workshop")


### Writing a thesis workflow workshop

After my bachelor thesis I was frustrated that the writing workflow is so hard to learn. That's why I made a workshop about it at [IIIT Karlsruhe](https://www.iiit.kit.edu/ "IIIT Karlsruhe"). 
The project name is [Tips und Tricks zur Ausarbeitung (TiTrAa)](https://github.com/theRealSuperMario/titraa_public/blob/master/MARKDOWN/index.markdown "Github Repository"). Public material is available on github.

### Linux workshops

I gave Linux Workshops at AKK Karlsruhe together with [Meteorkeks](https://github.com/Meteorkeks "Meteorkeks on github").
[Find the notes on github](https://github.com/theRealSuperMario/LinuxWorkshop "See github repository")

### Math Tutorials

I gave math tutorials from 2014 to 2016. At some point I started having a feedbackloop where people just hit a button before leaving to answer the question "Did you understand everything today". I monitored it over the weeks to see what I need to improve on. I specifically wrote an app for that because there was nothing out there that had what I wanted.
