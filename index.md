I'm a Master student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with a background in signal processing.
I have past experience on computational cameras and displays, image quality assessment and motion artefact reduction in magnetic resonance images and deep learning. 

Currently, I am focussing on more theoretical parts of machine learning while increasing my hands-on experience through semantic segmentation of lidar data.

In my spare time I organize events through [Hack & Söhne](https://hackundsoehne.de/ "Hack & Soehne Website") and [take photos](/photos/ "Check out my gallery").
[Follow me on github](https://github.com/therealsupermario "Sandro on Github").
