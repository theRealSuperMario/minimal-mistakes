# About Me

I'm a Master student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with a background in signal processing.
I have past experience on computational cameras and displays, image quality assessment and motion artefact reduction in magnetic resonance images and deep learning. 

Currently, I am interested in
more theoretical parts of machine learning.
